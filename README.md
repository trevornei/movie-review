# Movie Review

**Coding Steps**:

* Using what you've learned this week, create a page of an application that enables users to vote and leave reviews on movies.

* All data necessary for this assignment, including Movies and Reviews, can be pulled from an API or you can create the Movies and their Reviews yourself.

**Your application must include the following components**:
* **MovieList**: a container for all the Movie components and their data.  
* **Movie**: a component that represents movie data (i.e. image, synopsis, rating, etcâ€¦)
* **Stars**: a one to five-star rating component that allows users to rate something (movies in this case, but remember that components are reusable, so you could use it elsewhere!)
* **ReviewList**: a container inside of a Movie that houses Review components.
* **Review**: A text review a user can leave on a movie.
* **ReviewForm**: a form at the bottom of a Movie component that allows users to leave reviews. When submitted, the review should be added to the movie. * * All this data can be *stored in an array*, no networking or database needed for this assignment.
