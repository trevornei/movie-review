# Movie Review

**Coding Steps**:

* Using what you've learned this week, create a page of an application that enables users to vote and leave reviews on movies.

* All data necessary for this assignment, including Movies and Reviews, can be pulled from an API or you can create the Movies and their Reviews yourself.

**Your application must include the following components**:
* **MovieList**: a container for all the Movie components and their data.  
* **Movie**: a component that represents movie data (i.e. image, synopsis, rating, etc…)
* **Stars**: a one to five-star rating component that allows users to rate something (movies in this case, but remember that components are reusable, so you could use it elsewhere!)
* **ReviewList**: a container inside of a Movie that houses Review components.
* **Review**: A text review a user can leave on a movie.
* **ReviewForm**: a form at the bottom of a Movie component that allows users to leave reviews. When submitted, the review should be added to the movie. * * All this data can be *stored in an array*, no networking or database needed for this assignment.

    "Reviews" to hardcode: 
    Howl's Moving Castle (Positive):
"A visual masterpiece, 'Howl's Moving Castle' is a poignant tale that interweaves love, war, and self-discovery. Studio Ghibli's enchanting animation and characters come to life, drawing viewers into a whimsical world that resonates deeply with the young and old alike. It’s a testament to the unparalleled storytelling prowess of Hayao Miyazaki."

A Man Named Otto (Negative):
"While 'A Man Named Otto' promises an intriguing premise of mystery and discovery, it unfortunately falls flat in its execution. The pacing is inconsistent, and some plotlines seem underdeveloped or redundant. A potentially captivating narrative is marred by missed opportunities and predictable twists."

Parasite (Positive):
"Bong Joon-ho's 'Parasite' is a masterclass in genre-blending, effortlessly shifting from dark comedy to harrowing suspense. The film’s incisive critique of class disparities and its richly layered narrative are both thought-provoking and deeply unsettling. An absolute must-watch that pushes the boundaries of contemporary cinema."

Genndy Tartakovsky's Primal Animated Series (Negative):
"Though visually striking, 'Primal' feels like a missed opportunity to delve deeper into the dynamics of its main duo. Its reliance on episodic encounters occasionally makes the series feel redundant, lacking a cohesive overarching narrative. The raw emotion is palpable, but it often gets lost amidst the repetitive nature of the story."

Step Brothers (Positive):
"A hilarious and uproarious dive into the absurdity of late-blooming adulthood, 'Step Brothers' is comedy gold. Ferrell and Reilly's on-screen chemistry is undeniable, delivering laugh-out-loud moments in even the most ludicrous of scenarios. It's a delightful blend of slapstick and heart."

The Big Short (Negative):
"While 'The Big Short' attempts to provide a biting commentary on the 2008 financial crisis, it often gets bogged down in its own self-importance. The convoluted narrative, mixed with sporadic comedic moments, feels disjointed, making it hard for the audience to truly engage. It's ambitious but struggles to find its footing amidst the cacophony of characters and subplots."
